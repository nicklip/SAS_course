###_SAS Programming Course at CSU East Bay_

This is my code from the SAS programming course I took in graduate school. Included is code I wrote for the homework assignments, the midterm, and the final exam. 

A select number of the homework questions/instructions are included as comments in the code. I will be updating this repository with the instructions for all of the assignments and the utilized data files very soon.

This course covered the following topics:  
* Data Steps  
* Macros  
* SAS SQL  
* File I/O  
* Dates  
* Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and PROC GLM  
* Data manipulation, formatting, and sorting  
* Using ods for document creation  
* Control and Loops  
* Arrays  
* Summarizing Data  
* Handling Missing Values  
* Built-in SAS Functions  
* Numerical Calculations
